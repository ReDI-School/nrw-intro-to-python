# Lecture 14: Numpy and Pandas
## Goal for this Lecture
Introduce you to two fundamental libraries within the Python ecosystem for handling numerical data. The classes and functionality provided by them is used in a multitude of other python packages and used extensively in particular in Data Science/Data Analytics use cases, where python is extremely popular.

## Contents
We will cover

1. Numpy arrays and how to access values in them+
2. Mathematical computations on numpy arrays
3. Pandas DataFrames

## Learning Targets
After completing this lecture, you should be able to perform basic operations with arrays and DataFrames.

## Prerequisites
You should have

* Python installed
* Be able to interact with Jupyter Notebooks (preferably using Jupyter Lab)
* Have some recollection of high-school math (linear algebra)
