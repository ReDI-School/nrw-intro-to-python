    "# Getting started with Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask is a framework that lets you develop your own web apps. Today, we\n",
    "are going to use it to create an API that we can then test locally and\n",
    "later publish to the cloud!\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to install Flask, you need to use `pip install flask jsonify`.\n",
    "With this command, we are also installing jsonify, which helps convert\n",
    "objects to JSON data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The app\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking in the requirements is a crucial step when you start developing\n",
    "your application. In our case, the requirements aren't many. Contoso Books Ltd would like us to:  \n",
    "- Develop a book store app\n",
    "- Users need to list all books, search for books and access books via ISBN\n",
    "- Users should be able to create new books, updating is not required\n",
    "- Users should be able to delete books\n",
    "- Books consist of isbn, author and name. Optionally, they may have a description.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think a moment about what this means for the methods our app needs to support.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thought about it? Great. Listing all books sounds just like GET, while creating\n",
    "new books would rather be POST. Deleting a book can be achieved with DELETE.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the customer did not specify any other purposes for their store, we\n",
    "can assume that we only need one API endpoint: Books! Books are the only\n",
    "type of resource we store here.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means, our URIs will look like `https://contoso.books/Books` and \n",
    "`https://contoso.books/Books/1473200261`. Since the user needs to be able\n",
    "to search for books, the URIs will need to contain parameters, which we\n",
    "have gotten to know as Query Strings.\n",
    "So, a URI might also look like `https://contoso.books/Books?author=Terry%20Pratchett`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we need to create books, we not only need to take in qery strings\n",
    "but also a JSON body.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, we need to import flask and create a list of books. In a real scenario\n",
    "the list of books would be stored in a relational database! Here, for the\n",
    "sake of simplicity, we use a list. This of course means that after a restart, all books\n",
    "are reset."
