    "# Coding Challenge 2: Text Encoding\n",
    "In this coding challenge, you will write code that can encode and decode text to \"translate\" strings e.g. to morse code or to accomplish a (certainly very simple and not secure) \"encryption\" of a text you want to send to your friends.\n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge will revisit some of the topics discussed in the previous classes, among them:\n",
    "* Dealing with strings, dictionaries and lists\n",
    "* writing functions\n",
    "* Working with Exceptions\n",
    "* Object Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
    "* and testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Since you have matured as a programmer, we will mostly program outside of this notebook, using it only for reference. You will also add test cases as you progress to make sure your work is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will not be writing the code from scratch but you will be using, extending, and subclassing a base class that also defines the main interface your code should provide to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `baseencoder.py` module you will find the `BaseEncoder` class. It provides two main methods:\n",
    "* `encode` accepts a string in plain language and returns the encoded text.\n",
    "* `decode` should reverse the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `BaseEncoder` class is not particularly useful as of now, but we will be working to extend it. See it in action first!"
