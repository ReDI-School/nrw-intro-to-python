# Lecture 04: Loops
## Goal for this Lecture
Introduce you to the basic mechanisms in Python to control the sequence in which instructions in your program are executed (control the _"flow"_ of the program).

## Contents
We will cover

1. If/else statements to execute statements based on conditions at the time of execution
2. for-Loops to execute statements multiple times
3. while loops (to repeat code until a condition is met)

## Learning Targets
After completing this lecture, you should be able to use the above mentioned flow control mechanisms in your Python programs.

## Prerequisites
You should have

* Python installed
* Be able to interact with Jupyter Notebooks (preferably using Jupyter Lab)
* Have an understanding of basic Python datatypes (in particular, `bool` variables)
